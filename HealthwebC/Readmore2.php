                <h1>Identified:</h1> South Africa<br><br>
                
                <h2>Spread:</h2> Spreads more easily than other variants. CDC is working with state and local public health officials to monitor the spread of Omicron.<br><br>
                
                <h1>Symptoms:</h1> Please refer to Symptoms of COVID-19 | CDC<br><br>
                
                <h1>Severe illness and death:</h1>Severe illness and death: Data suggest that Omicron is less severe in general. However, a surge in cases may lead to significant increases in hospitalization and death. More data are needed to fully understand the severity of illness and death associated with this variant.
                <br><br>
                <h1>Vaccine:</h1> Breakthrough infections in people who are vaccinated are expected, but being up to date on recommended vaccines is effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. The emergence of the Omicron variant further emphasizes the importance of vaccination and boosters.
                <br><br>
                <h1>Treatments:</h1> Some, but not all, monoclonal antibody treatments remain effective against Omicron. Public health agencies work with healthcare providers to ensure that effective treatments are used appropriately to treat patients.<br><br><br>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">If you think about a virus like a tree growing and branching out; each branch on the tree is slightly different than the others. By comparing the branches, scientists can label them according to the differences. These small differences, or variants, have been studied and identified since the beginning of the pandemic.<br><br>

                Some variations allow the virus to spread more easily or make it resistant to treatments or vaccines. Those variants must be monitored more carefully.<br><br>
                As the virus spreads, it has new opportunities to change and may become more difficult to stop. These changes can be monitored by comparing differences in physical traits (such as resistance to treatment) or changes in genetic code (mutations) from one variant to another.<br><br><br></p>

                Wear a well-fitted mask to help protect yourself and others.<br>

                Test to prevent spread to others.<br>
                Stay 6 feet apart from others who don’t live with you.<br>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">How Variants Are Classified</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) established a SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group (SIG) to enhance coordination among CDC, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and Department of Defense (DoD). This interagency group is focused on the rapid characterization of emerging variants and actively monitors their potential impact on critical SARS-CoV-2 countermeasures, including vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.<br><br>

                The SIG meets regularly to evaluate the risk posed by SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the United States and to make recommendations about the classification of variants. This evaluation is undertaken by a group of subject matter experts who assess available data, including variant proportions at the national and regional levels and the potential or known impact of the constellation of mutations on the effectiveness of medical countermeasures, severity of disease, and ability to spread from person to person. Given the continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and our understanding of the impact of variants on public health, variants may be reclassified based on their attributes and prevalence in the United States.<br><br>
                <h2>Notes:</h2> Each variant classification includes the possible attributes of lower classes (for example, VOC includes the possible attributes of VOI); variant status might escalate or deescalate based on emerging scientific evidence. This page will be updated as needed to show the variants that belong to each class. The World Health Organization (WHO) external icon also classifies variant viruses as variants of concern and variants of interest; U.S. classifications may differ from those of WHO because the impact of variants may differ by location. To assist with public discussions of variants, WHO proposed using labels consisting of the Greek alphabet (for example, alpha, beta, gamma) as a practical way to discuss variants for non-scientific audiences. The labels assigned to each variant are provided in the tables below.<br><br><br></p>

    <section class="section4">
        <div class="paras">
            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Variant of Interest (VOI)</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">A variant with specific genetic markers that have been associated with changes to receptor binding, reduced neutralization by antibodies generated against previous infection or vaccination, reduced efficacy of treatments, potential diagnostic impact, or predicted increase in transmissibility or disease severity.<br>

                Possible attributes of a Variant of Interest:<br>
                
                1.Specific genetic markers that are predicted to affect transmission, diagnostics, therapeutics, or immune escape.<br>
                2.Evidence that it is the cause of an increased proportion of cases or unique outbreak clusters.<br>
                3.Limited prevalence or expansion in the US or in other countries.<br>
                A Variant of Interest might require one or more appropriate public health actions, including enhanced sequence surveillance, enhanced laboratory characterization, or epidemiological investigations to assess how easily the virus spreads to others, the severity of disease, the efficacy of therapeutics and whether currently approved or authorized vaccines offer protection.<br><br><br></p>
