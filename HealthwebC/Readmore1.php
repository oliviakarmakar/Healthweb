        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">
          You can choose from many different types of tests.<br />
          Tests for SARS-CoV-2(the virus that causes COVID-19) tell you if you
          have an infection at the time of the test. This type of test is called
          a viral test because it looks for viral infection.<br />
          Regardless of the test type you select, a positive test result means
          that you have an infection and should isolate and inform your close
          contacts to avoid spreading disease to others.<br />
          Over-the-counter self-tests are viral tests that can be used at home
          or anywhere, are easy to use, and produce rapid results. Anyone can
          use self-tests, regardless of their vaccination status or whether they
          have symptoms.<br />
          COVID-19 self-tests are one of many risk-reduction measures, along
          with vaccination, masking, and physical distancing, that protect you
          and others by reducing the chances of spreading COVID-19.<br /><br /><br />

          Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
          especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing

          If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that
          contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and
          rub them together until they feel dry.<br />
