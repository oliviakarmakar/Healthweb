          How does Covid-19 spread between two people.....
        </p>
        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">
          We know that the disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which
          spreads between people in several different ways.<br /><br />

          Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people
          who are in close contact with each other, for example at a
          conversational distance. The virus can spread from an infected
          person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough,
          sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. Another person can then contract the
          virus when infectious particles that pass through the air are inhaled
          at short range (this is often called short-range aerosol or
          short-range airborne transmission) or if infectious particles come
          into direct contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth (droplet
          transmission).<br /><br />

          The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor
          settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is
          because aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther
          than conversational distance (this is often called long-range aerosol
          or long-range airborne transmission).<br /><br />

          People may also become infected when touching their eyes, nose or
          mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated
          by the virus. <br /><br />
          Further research is ongoing to better understand the spread of the
          virus and which settings are most risky and why. Research is also
          under way to study virus variants that are emerging and why some are
          more transmissible. For updated information on SARS-CoV-2 variants,
          please read the weekly epidemiologic updates.

          Are there certain settings where Covid-19 can spread more easily?....
        </p>
        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">
          Yes, any situation in which people are in close proximity to one
          another for long periods of time increases the risk of transmission.
          Indoor locations, especially settings where there is poor ventilation,
          are riskier than outdoor locations. Activities where more particles
          are expelled from the mouth, such as singing or breathing heavily
          during exercise, also increase the risk of transmission.<br /><br />

          The “Three C’s” are a useful way to think about this. They describe
          settings where transmission of the COVID-19 virus spreads more
          easily:<br /><br />

          1) Crowded places;<br />
          2)Close-contact settings, especially where people have conversations
          very near each other;<br />
          3)Confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.<br /><br />
          The risk of COVID-19 spreading is especially high in places where
          these “3Cs” overlap.

          How can We reduce my risk of getting Covid-19....
        </p>
        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">
          There are many things you can do to keep yourself and your loved ones
          safe from COVID-19. Know your risks to lower risks. Follow these basic
          precautions:<br /><br />

          1)Follow local guidance: Check to see what national, regional and
          local authorities are advising so you have the most relevant
          information for where you are.<br />
          2)Keep your distance: Stay at least 1 metre away from others, even if
          they don’t appear to be sick, since people can have the virus without
          having symptoms.<br />
          3)Wear a mask: Wear a well-fitting three-layer mask, especially when
          you can’t physically distance, or if you’re indoors. Clean your hands
          before putting on and taking off a mask.<br />
          4)Read our Masks and COVID-19 Q&A and watch our videos on how to wear
          and make masks.<br />
          5)Avoid crowded places, poorly ventilated, indoor locations and avoid
          prolonged contact with others. Spend more time outdoors than
          indoors.<br />
          6)Ventilation is important: Open windows when indoors to increase the
          amount of outdoor air.<br />
          7)Avoid touching surfaces, especially in public settings or health
          facilities, in case people infected with COVID-19 have touched them.
          Clean surfaces regularly with standard disinfectants.<br />
          8)Frequently clean your hands with soap and water, or an alcohol-based
          hand rub. If you can, carry alcohol-based rub with you and use it
          often.<br />
          9)Cover your coughs and sneezes with a bent elbow or tissue, throwing
          used tissues into a closed bin right away. Then wash your hands or use
          an alcohol-based hand rub.<br />
          10)Get vaccinated: When it’s your turn, get vaccinated. Follow local
          guidance and recommendations about vaccination.
